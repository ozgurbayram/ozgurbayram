# Özgür Bayram

Software Engineer focused on building **high-quality mobile and full-stack systems**.

I work primarily with **React Native and TypeScript**, and I care deeply about **performance, clean architecture, and long-term maintainability**. Most of my work involves production systems with real users, real constraints, and real failure modes.

## Focus Areas

- Mobile applications at scale (React Native)
- Type-safe frontend architecture (TypeScript)
- Backend systems and API design
- Performance optimization and runtime efficiency
- Clean Architecture, SOLID principles
- Developer experience and maintainability

---

## Technologies I Use

**Mobile**
- React Native, TypeScript
- Reanimated, Native Modules
- Platform-specific integrations (Android / iOS)

**Frontend**
- React, Next.js
- Redux Toolkit, RTK Query

**Backend**
- Node.js, .NET Core
- REST APIs, WebSockets, real-time systems

**Data & Infrastructure**
- MySQL, MSSQL, Redis
- CI/CD, Azure DevOps
- Firebase

## Engineering Philosophy

- Simple systems scale better than clever ones  
- Performance issues are usually architectural  
- Code is a liability unless it is easy to change  
- Tooling should serve the product, not the other way around
